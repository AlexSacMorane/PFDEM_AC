# PFDEM_AC

Phase-Field Discrete Element Modelisation applied to granular material.

## WARNING !

Please go to the more updated branch LikeSantamarina2009.

## Simulation presentation
This simulation is about a 2D test under oedometrical conditions with an acid injection to dissolve a fraction of the particles.

The chain force and the k0 (= &sigma;<sub>2</sub>/&sigma;<sub>1</sub>) evolves with the material dissolution. The influence of the shape of the dissolvable particles is discussed.

## Technical description
The PFDEM is a discussion between phase-field (PF) simulation and discrete element modelization (DEM). Even if those formulations are different, they can collaborate with data exchange.

The [phase-field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-field_model) is based on the mesh of the sample and grains are represented by a phase variable (= 1 if the node is a grain, = 0 else). This formulation transmit to the DEM the shape of the grain. Hence, a grain detection algorithm is used to extract the shape from the phase field. In this case, no information about the solute is needed as it is assumed the solute is instantaneously evacuated.

The [discrete element model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_element_method) does not need mesh and grains are represented by a list of vertices (here polygonal grains are assumed). The role of the DEM is to compute the position of the grains. Then, an algorithm is used to convert the grain position in a new phase-field. The mechanical energy at the contact level is not considered as the acid is the motor term of the dissolution.

A back and forth is done between phase-field (PF) simulation and discrete element modelisation (DEM). Hence, once a steady-state is reached with the DEM, the phase-field theory is called. The shape of the grains will change and the steady state is not verified and must be computed by a new DEM step.
The following schemes illustrate the algorithm.

Phase-field approach is computed with [MOOSE](https://github.com/idaholab/moose) (the solver must be correctly installed) and DEM is computed with an own script based on python 3.9.6. The launch of this project is done by executing the python script <i>main.py</i> (multiple run can be asked with <i>multiple_main.py</i>). The user can change variables inside the python script <i>User.py</i>. A section in the following helps to understand the different inputs.

Saves are done before the phase-field simulation and at the end of the DEM. If crash (it seems to happend often during the phase-field simulation with MOOSE) occurs during the simulation, the function <i>main_after_crash.py</i> can be called to come back before the crash.

A [documentation](https://alexsacmorane.github.io/pfdem_ac) for the python script is available.

### Phase-field
The goal of the phase-field step is to compute the shape of the grains as it evolves with the dissolution.
An Allen-Cahn formulation is used. Hence, the conservation of the mass should not be verified as dissolution occurs.

### DEM
The goal of the DEM step is to compute a steady-state configuration. Grains are assumed as polygonal. The shape is computed from an interpolation of the phase variable. At the end of the step, interactions (grain-grain and grain-wall) are computed to highlight the evolution of the chain force and k0.

## What is next ?
Some next releases are presented here.

- find a way to multiproccess the DEM simulation
- add rolling resistance
- increase the user experience (homogenize names, correct english)
- create AI or a guide to select algorithm parameters (as neighborhood update frequency, time step, stop criteria, etc...)
- add some quick tests to check the script
- correct the functions P_is_inside() because if the coordinate y = the coordinate of the vertex, the point is considered outside (even  if it is not the case)
- publish an article about the simulation and result

## Understand User.py
